== Overview ==

Cargo is an extension to MediaWiki that provides a lightweight way
to store and query the data contained within the calls to templates, such
as infoboxes.

The extension defines the following parser functions:

* #cargo_declare - placed within the <noinclude> part of a template; it
defines the schema for a table.

* #cargo_attach - also placed within the <noinclude> part of a template;
specifies that a template adds rows to a table declared elsewhere.

* #cargo_store - stores one row to a Cargo table; usually placed within
the <includeonly> part of a template.

* #cargo_query - queries one or more Cargo data tables, using SQL
components.

* #cargo_compound_query - calls multiple queries, and displays the
results together.

* #cargo_display_map - displays a map showing a single point.

* #recurring_event - outputs a string holding a list of dates for a
recurring event, for use by #cargo_store.
